### A graph of the most expensive buildings ever built, along with the year they were built in. This graph was made for a data journalism class project. It's purpose is to show a time series of the construction of expensive buildings across the world. Due to Chartbuilder's layout, the names and locations of the buildings were not included. I received the data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_buildings).
